I have a PhD in Computer Science from Imperial College London, studied Mathematics at Cambridge and worked as a Physicist at CERN prior to that.  

Today I'm a management consultant, writer, and scientist. 

Those three things all involve precise, high-quality, and high-fidelity communication. To communicate something well, you have to understand it. 
This website exists mainly to test, challenge, and cement my (and hopefully your) understanding of the topics covered. 

I write about what interests me. I'm Ali and this is my blog.
