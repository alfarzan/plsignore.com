I'm a management consultant, writer, and scientist. 

Those three things all involve precise, high-quality, and high-fidelity communication. This kind of communciation is necessary for society to work well toegther[^1]. The quality and fidelity of communication are also functions of how well the writer understands two things: the audience and, the topic. On the internet I don't have to worry about the audience too much since that tends to be a self-selecting process -- the people who find my writing interesting will find my writing. Here I worry about the topic and my understanding of it. 

This website exists mainly to test, challenge, and cement my (and hopefully your) understanding of the topics covered. 

I write about what interests me. I'm Ali and this is my blog.
